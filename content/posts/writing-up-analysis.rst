I've been working on a few rules, ideas to keep in mind whenever you are
writing analysis. These aren't immutable rules, they're guidelines and
meant to be bent and broken.

It is very tempting as a scientist and analyst to write very detailed
and technical write ups. Much like a scientific paper for business.
Unfortunately, this is seldom the most effective way to present your
findings.

By keeping the following guidelines in your head when writing and
proof-reading your write ups, it will make your delivery much more
effective. There's no point doing clever work if nobody reads it, or
acts on it.

Your job is to show people what they should do
==============================================

As an analyst the part of your job that takes most time is the data
analysis. It is therefore tempting to make the number crunching
methodology the focus of your write up - you spent all this time doing
fancy data analysis, you want to tell people about it in great detail.

This is a bad idea. The detailed description of your method isn't
important or interesting to anybody except you.

The important part of your job isn't the number crunching. The important
part of your job is telling people what they should do.

Your analysis will create important findings, facts that really matter
to your business. You have to make sure that these important findings
are the things that people take away from reading your write-up.

To draw an analogy with coding - you are trying to program people's
brains, making sure that they take the correct actions. Your write up is
your source code. Make sure that it does the job of implanting the
correct ideas in people's heads, and doesn't lead them down the wrong
paths.

Remove anything you don't really need
=====================================

.. epigraph::

    Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but
    when there is nothing left to take away.

    —Antoine de Saint-Exupery

A wonderful quote. Saint-Exupery was a writer of fiction and poetry, but
this idea is equally applicable to analysis write ups.

.. note::

    Antoine de Saint-Exupery was a really interesting character, a French
    aristrocrat, writer, poet and aviator. Well worth ten minutes on
    `wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry>`__.

Ask yourself "*Why am I saying this, what is the value?*\ ". If you
can't think of a good reason for saying something, don't say it.

Here are some examples of good and bad reasons to include something in
your writeup.


+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
|    Good reasons                                |  Bad reasons                                   |
+================================================+================================================+
|    It answers an important question            |  It makes you look clever                      |
+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
|    It raises an important question, something  |  Something that purely looks pretty or fancy   |
|    that someone has to go and answer           |  - plots just there to look cool, LaTex        |
|                                                |  equations purely to look impressive           |
+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
|    There is an action that has to be taken     |  Something that is interesting, but doesn't    |
|                                                |  really matter to anyone                       |
+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
|                                                |  You are worried that someone might ask you    |
|                                                |  a tricky question; you are trying to cover    |
|                                                |  all the bases                                 |
+------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+

This doesn't mean that you can't include things that look cool, or are
there purely for interest. Just make sure that the important things take
precedence. Maybe put the impressive equations and pretty graphs in an
appendix. Save the interesting facts with no immediate relevance for
your chat around the kettle.

I often find it more effective to write up my analysis in a couple of
sentences, rather than a 30 slide presentation. This means that your
stakeholder reads all of it and all the important messages are
guaranteed to enter their brain.

This takes a lot of confidence in your abilities and the quality of your
work. You know that you've done all the work necessary. You know that
the messages you're delivering are the correct ones. You know that if
someone comes back to you requesting more detail, you'll be able to give
it to them.

Striving for simplicity is a useful way of thinking. Simpler isn't
always better though, sometimes it is necessary to include more detail.
This is a tricky balancing act, and part of the skill of writing
analysis well.

.. epigraph::

    Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

    —Albert Einstein

Know your stakeholders
======================

Understanding the people who are reading your write up is very
important. Try and think of the following things, even before you start
your analysis.

#. Why are they asking this question? Why do they want to know this
   nugget of information?
#. Are they asking the correct question? You might want to go back to
   them and ask them *"Are you really interested in this other thing
   instead?"*
#. What is the best way to give them your analysis?

The first two points are about defining your analysis properly. This
makes sure that you answer the valuable questions, you don't waste your
time and theirs by finding interesting stuff that isn't relevant.

It is helpful to think of this as a type of requirements gathering,
maybe you'll find it best to write a document describing the agreed
methodology before starting your analysis.

This is important not just when you are starting a new type of analysis,
but also when you are working on an ongoing project. Say you've been
creating the same weekly report for a year now, you agreed a year ago
what you were to show and what questions you were to answer. Are those
same questions still relevant? Does anyone still read your report?
Should you change the contents? Is everyone comfortable now, can you
just produce highlights of the report?

The third point is about how best to present your analysis. Some
stakeholders are highly technical and love nothing more than poring over
a spreadsheet and finding all the details they like. Other stakeholders
might be scared of numbers, and need to have their hands held while
being taken through your analysis. Some busy executives might not have
time to read all your full analysis, maybe you want to give them some
heavily edited highlights.

These three things are much easier if you have a close relationship with
your stakeholders. If you can take time to understand what they need, it
will make your life easier in the long-run.
