Hello!

I'm planning to write this blog about acquiring a usable dataset,
crunching (analysing) this data and then presenting analysis to other people.
I'm very interested in this field and I think these three threads are all very exciting.

As a first post I'll put a quote from Richard Feynman,
he's a cool dude.

.. epigraph::

    Well, Mr. Frankel, who started this program, began to suffer from the computer disease that anybody who works with computers now knows about. It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is you **play** with them.

    -- Richard P. Feynman *Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman*
