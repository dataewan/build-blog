--------

My name is Ewan Nicolson.
I'm from Scotland.
Hiya!

I studied Physics,
and I've worked extensively in number-crunching and data analysis in various industries.

I love applying my scientific background to my work.
I also enjoy finding new methods and techniques to apply.
I plan to write about that here.
